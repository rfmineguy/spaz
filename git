This is a big commit:
Removed TERMINAL_OP and RESERVED. Replaced with dedicated ASTNode;
Added new ASTNode StatementExpression to support blocks;
Added ast_print_node_lite (without all the baggage of ast_print_node);
Added verbose flag;
Modified reduction function to support StatementExpression, and the rest of the rules that used expressions are translated to this new ASTNode;
BIG:: Added a reduction rule for block statements (Note: this is still kind of ugly but it works)
Finally I padded the values of the token types
